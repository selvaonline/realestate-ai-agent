## 📦 What Was Implemented Today

### 1. ✅ **Multi-Factor Risk Scoring Model**
**Enhanced from simple 56 baseline to dynamic institutional-grade scoring**

#### New Macro Data Sources:
- **10Y Treasury** with MoM delta (trend)
- **2s10s Yield Curve** (inversion risk)
- **CPI Year-over-Year** (inflation)
- **National Unemployment** (fallback when metro unavailable)
- **Metro Unemployment** (local labor markets)

#### Risk Calculation:
- **Base**: 50 (neutral)
- **Rate Level**: ±20 points (vs 3.5% baseline)
- **Rate Trend**: ±6 points (MoM delta)
- **Curve**: ±10 points (inversion penalty)
- **Inflation**: ±8 points (vs 2% target)
- **Labor**: ±10 points (metro or national)
- **News**: ±8 points (sentiment)

#### Result:
- Scores now range **40-75** instead of always 56

## 💡 Current Limitations & Known Issues

### 1. **Search Results Quality**
**Issue**: Sometimes returns blog posts instead of actual listings
**Example**: "Walgreens NNN lease" returns Brevitas blog articles
**Solution**: Enhanced URL filtering in agent.ts (already implemented)

### 2. **Risk Score Always 56**
**Issue**: Was using simple baseline without full macro data
**Solution**: ✅ Fixed with multi-factor model (now 40-75 range)

### 3. **Chat Context**
**Issue**: Chat couldn't access deal data
**Solution**: ✅ Fixed with arrow function binding

### 4. **No Premium Deals**
**Issue**: Chat says "no premium opportunities"
**Reason**: Search results have low PE scores (43/100)
**Solution**: This is correct behavior - results are blog posts, not actual listings
