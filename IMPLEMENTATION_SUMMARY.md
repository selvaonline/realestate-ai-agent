  - `README.md` - Updated with new features

- [x] **Technical Documentation**
  - `docs/FLOW_DIAGRAM.md` - Sequence and state diagrams
  - `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` - Implementation guide
  - `docs/BEFORE_AFTER.md` - Comparison and metrics

- [x] **Memory**
  - Created persistent memory of implementation

## 🎯 What Was Built

### New Event Types
```typescript
thinking        → "Understanding your query..."
source_found    → {id: 1, title: "...", url: "...", snippet: "..."}
answer_chunk    → "Progressive text streaming..."
answer_complete → Signal synthesis done
```

### UI Components
```
Thinking Steps Section
├── 🔍 Icon
└── Thinking text (gray)

Answer Section
├── Streaming text (white)
└── Typing indicator • • • (animated)

Sources Section
├── "Sources" heading
└── Source Items
    ├── [n] Citation number
    ├── Title (link)
    └── Snippet
```

### User Flow
```
1. User enters query
2. See thinking steps appear
3. Sources populate as found
4. Answer streams with citations
5. Sources section expands
6. Deal cards display
```

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Transparent Reasoning
Agent shows its thinking process step-by-step, building user trust.

### 2. Source Attribution
Every piece of information has a numbered citation [1], [2], [3] linking back to the source.

### 3. Streaming Synthesis
Answer builds progressively as information is gathered, keeping users engaged.

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
Information reveals in stages: thinking → sources → answer → deals.

### 5. Professional UI
Clean, modern design inspired by Perplexity with dark theme and smooth animations.

## 📈 Benefits

### For Users

- **Extensibility** - Easy to add new event types
- **Maintainability** - Clean separation of concerns
- **Testability** - Events can be mocked and tested

### For Business
- **Differentiation** - Unique Perplexity-style UX
- **Professional** - Modern, polished interface
- **Scalable** - Pattern works for any agent
- **Competitive** - Matches best-in-class AI products

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why SSE over WebSockets?
- Simpler implementation
- One-way communication sufficient
- Better HTTP/2 support
- Easier debugging

### Why Inline Citations?
- User familiarity with [1], [2] notation
- Easy to implement
- Works well with streaming
- Proven pattern (Perplexity, Bing)

### Why Signal-based State?
- Angular 16+ best practice
- Automatic change detection
- Better performance
- Cleaner code

### Why Collapsible Timeline?
- Clean default view
- Power users can expand
- Backward compatible
- No information loss

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

All changes are **backward compatible**:
- Old events still work
- Server handles any event type
- Timeline preserved in details
- No breaking API changes
