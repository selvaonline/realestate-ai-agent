# LoopNet Blocking Issue & Solutions

## Problem
LoopNet has strong anti-bot detection that blocks automated browsers (Playwright/Puppeteer). Even with stealth mode improvements, LoopNet can detect and block the scraper.

## What I've Implemented
1. ✅ Enhanced Chromium stealth mode with better headers
2. ✅ Removed automation detection signals
3. ✅ Added human-like delays and scrolling behavior
4. ✅ Updated User-Agent to latest Chrome version
5. ✅ Added sec-ch-ua headers for better fingerprinting

## Why LoopNet is Hard to Scrape
- Advanced bot detection (Cloudflare/PerimeterX)
- Canvas fingerprinting
- WebGL fingerprinting  
- JavaScript challenges
- Rate limiting

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Focus on Crexi (Recommended) ✅
Crexi works much better and has similar listings. The agent already tries Crexi first in searches.

**Test this:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/run_sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Find retail properties in Nashville"}'
```

### Option 2: Use LoopNet API (If Available)
- Check if LoopNet offers an official API
- Some commercial real estate APIs aggregate LoopNet data
- Cost: Usually paid subscription

### Option 3: Residential Proxies
Install proxy support:
```bash
npm install playwright-extra puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth
```

Use rotating residential proxies (costs $):
- Bright Data
- Oxylabs  
- SmartProxy

### Option 4: Selenium Stealth
Switch from Playwright to Selenium with better stealth:
```bash
npm install selenium-webdriver undetected-chromedriver
```

### Option 5: Manual API Extraction
If you have specific properties, you can:
1. Visit LoopNet manually
2. Copy the URL
3. Extract data using browser DevTools
4. Input as structured data

## Current Status
- ✅ **Crexi**: Working well
- ✅ **7-Eleven, CVS, Costco**: Extracting from Crexi successfully  
- ⚠️ **LoopNet**: Blocked by anti-bot measures
- ✅ **Search**: Finding listings works
- ⚠️ **Extraction**: Fails on LoopNet specifically

## Recommended Action
**Use Crexi URLs** or **search by criteria** (not direct LoopNet URLs):

### Good Queries:
```
"Find retail properties in Nashville"
"7-Eleven properties for sale"  
"CVS pharmacy investment opportunities"
"Multifamily deals in Dallas with cap rate > 6%"
```

### Problematic:
```
https://www.loopnet.com/Listing/... (direct LoopNet URLs)
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Retail Search (Should Work)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/run_sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Find CVS properties for sale"}'
```

### Test 2: Crexi URL (Should Work)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/run_sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "https://www.crexi.com/properties/tenants/CVS_Pharmacy"}'
```

### Test 3: LoopNet URL (May Fail)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/run_sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "https://www.loopnet.com/Listing/..."}'
```

## Long-term Solution
1. Get LoopNet API access (if available)
2. Use commercial data providers (CoStar, PropertyShark)
3. Focus on Crexi + broker sites that don't block
4. Build relationships with brokers for MLS access

## UI Message for Users
When LoopNet fails, show:
```
⚠️ Unable to extract from LoopNet due to access restrictions.
Trying alternative sources (Crexi, broker sites)...
```
