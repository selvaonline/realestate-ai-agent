# Private Equity Scoring System - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## üéØ Strategy Shift: From Extraction-First to Score-First

### **Problem Solved**
Crexi is blocking BrightData proxies with HTTP errors, preventing page extraction. Rather than fighting the block, we now **deliver value immediately** through intelligent lead scoring, even without browsing.

### **New Flow**
```

## üìä PE Scoring Algorithm

### **Scoring Factors (0-100 Scale)**

#### 1. **Relevance (max 30 points)**
- Industrial/warehouse keywords: +22
- Target geography (FL/TX/CA): +8
- Query match bonus: +6
- **Purpose**: Ensure listings match investor criteria

#### 2. **Tenant Quality (max 20 points)**
- Credit tenant (CVS, Walgreens, Starbucks, etc.): +16
- Long-term lease (15+ years): +4
- **Purpose**: Reduce risk, ensure stable income

#### 3. **Lease Structure (max 15 points)**
- For sale/lease listing: +5
- NNN/Triple Net lease: +10
- **Purpose**: Favor bondable, passive investments

#### 4. **Yield Economics (max 20 points)**
- Cap rate scoring: 4% = 0 pts, 8% = 16 pts, 10% = 20 pts
- NOI/Price validation: +8 bonus
- **Purpose**: Identify high-yield opportunities

#### 5. **URL Quality (max 15 points)**
- Direct property page (crexi.com/property/...): +15
- Profile/brokerage page: -5
- **Purpose**: Filter out non-listing pages

### **Example Scores**

```
üèÜ 92/100 - Industrial ¬∑ NNN ¬∑ CVS ¬∑ 7.2% Cap ¬∑ $3.2M ¬∑ FL
   https://crexi.com/property/12345/florida-cvs-nnn

‚≠ê 78/100 - Industrial ¬∑ 6.5% Cap ¬∑ $2.8M ¬∑ TX
   https://crexi.com/sale/67890/texas-warehouse

‚úì  65/100 - Other ¬∑ STARBUCKS ¬∑ NNN ¬∑ CA

```

## üîß Implementation Details

### **Files Created/Modified**

#### ‚úÖ **New File: `orchestrator/src/tools/peScore.ts`**
- Extracts signals from title/snippet (price, cap rate, NOI, tenant, location)
- Scores each result 0-100 with transparent factor breakdown
- Returns sorted array with `peScore`, `peLabel`, `peFactors`, `peSignals`

#### ‚úÖ **Modified: `orchestrator/src/agent.ts`**
- Imports `peScore` tool
- Scores all search results immediately after Strategy 1
- Emits top 5 scored leads to UI as answer chunks
- Filters candidates by `MIN_BROWSE_SCORE` (default 70) before browsing
- Only attempts extraction on high-scoring detail pages

#### ‚úÖ **Modified: `orchestrator/.env.example`**
```bash
# PE Scoring
MIN_BROWSE_SCORE=70  # Only browse properties scoring >= this value
```

## üé® User Experience

### **What Users See Now**

1. **Immediate Value** (no extraction needed):
```
Top Investment Opportunities (PE Scored):

[1] Industrial Building with CVS Tenant ‚Äî 92/100 (Industrial ¬∑ NNN ¬∑ CVS ¬∑ 7.2% Cap ¬∑ FL)
https://crexi.com/property/12345/...

[2] Warehouse Distribution Center ‚Äî 78/100 (Industrial ¬∑ 6.5% Cap ¬∑ TX)
https://crexi.com/sale/67890/...

[3] Retail Pad Site ‚Äî 65/100 (Other ¬∑ STARBUCKS ¬∑ NNN ¬∑ CA)
https://crexi.com/property/24680/...
```

2. **Transparent Scoring**:
- Each result shows score (0-100)
- Label explains why it scored high (tenant, cap rate, location, etc.)
- Sources section shows full details with improved card UI

3. **Smart Browsing**:
- Only high-scoring properties (‚â•70) are browsed
- Saves time by skipping low-quality leads
- Still captures screenshots when extraction works

## üß™ Testing

### **Try These Queries**

```bash
# High-scoring: Industrial + NNN + Credit tenant
"Industrial properties with CVS or Walgreens tenant under $5M in Florida"

# Medium-scoring: Industrial + Cap rate
"Warehouse distribution centers 7% cap rate Texas"

# Lower-scoring: Retail without tenant
"Retail shopping centers under $15M"
```

### **Expected Output**
```
[peScore] Scoring 12 rows...
[peScore] Top 3 scores: 92 (Industrial Building - CVS Tenant...), 78 (Warehouse...), 65 (Retail...)
[agent] üìä PE Scored 12 results. Top 3:
[agent]   1. [92] Industrial ¬∑ NNN ¬∑ cvs ¬∑ 7.2% Cap ¬∑ $3.2M ¬∑ FL - Industrial Building - CVS Tenant...
[agent]   2. [78] Industrial ¬∑ 6.5% Cap ¬∑ $2.8M ¬∑ TX - Warehouse Distribution Center...
[agent]   3. [65] Other ¬∑ starbucks ¬∑ NNN ¬∑ CA - Retail Pad Site - Starbucks...
[agent] üìä Strategy 1 filtered to 2 detail URLs with score >= 70 (2 Crexi, 0 other)
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### **Environment Variables**

```bash
# .env
MIN_BROWSE_SCORE=70  # Set higher (80-90) to only browse premium opportunities
                      # Set lower (50-60) to browse more aggressively
                      # Set to 0 to browse all results (not recommended)
```

### **Tuning the Algorithm**

Edit `orchestrator/src/tools/peScore.ts`:

**Increase tenant importance:**
```typescript
const tenant = s.strongTenant ? 20 : 0;  // Was 16
```

**Favor higher cap rates:**
```typescript
yieldScore += Math.max(0, Math.min(25, Math.round((s.cap * 100 - 4) * 5))); // Was *4
```

**Add more premium tenants:**
```typescript
const TENANT_WHITELIST = [
  ...existing,
  "wholefoods", "traderjoes", "amazon", "apple"
];
```

## üéØ Key Insight

**You don't need perfect extraction to provide value.**  
Even basic signals (title, snippet, URL) contain enough information to rank opportunities intelligently. PE scoring turns search results into actionable intelligence **instantly**.

## üöÄ Ready to Test!

**Backend**: http://localhost:3001 (running with PE scoring)  
**Frontend**: http://localhost:4200

**Try a search and see:**
1. Immediate ranked results with scores
2. Improved sources UI with full details
3. Optional browsing only on high-scorers

**Watch the logs:**
