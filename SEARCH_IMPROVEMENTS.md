# Search Improvements Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Less Restrictive Search Queries

**Before:**
```typescript
// Very strict - required exact URL patterns
`${q} ((site:loopnet.com inurl:/Listing/) OR (site:crexi.com inurl:/property/) ...)`
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Strategy 1: Focus on sites but broader
`${q} (site:loopnet.com OR site:crexi.com) commercial real estate for sale`

// Strategy 2: Remove site restrictions
`${q} commercial property listing investment`

// Strategy 3: General search
`commercial real estate for sale ${q}`
```

### 2. ✅ More Fallback Search Patterns

- **3 progressive search strategies** instead of rigid patterns
- Each strategy gets broader if previous one finds < 3 candidates
- Candidates accumulate across strategies (deduplicated)
- Increased extraction attempts from 6 to 8 URLs

### 3. ✅ Improved Error Handling

**Fallback Always Triggers:**
- Added try-catch around fallback extraction
- Fallback now streams answer chunks (Perplexity-style)
- If fallback fails, shows helpful message to user
- All paths properly emit `answer_complete` event

**Better Recovery:**
```typescript
// Before: Silent failures
if (!blocked && meaningful) { ... }

// After: Comprehensive logging and user feedback
try {
  // extraction
} catch (e) {
  console.error("[agent] Fallback extraction error:", e);
}
if (deals.length === 0) {
  emit(ctx, "answer_chunk", { text: "Try a broader search..." });
}
```

### 4. ✅ Comprehensive Logging

Added logs at every step:

```typescript
// Search results
console.log("[agent] Search strategy 1:", detailQuery);
console.log(`[agent] Strategy 1 returned ${detail.length} results`);
console.log(`[agent] Strategy 1 detail URLs: ${candidates.length}`);

// Extraction attempts
console.log(`[agent] Attempting to extract from: ${url}`);
console.log(`[agent] Extraction result - blocked: ${blocked}, meaningful: ${meaningful}`);

// Final status
console.log(`[agent] Extraction attempts complete. Success: ${extractionSucceeded}`);
console.log(`[agent] Final deals count: ${deals.length}`);
```

## Benefits

1. **Higher Success Rate**: More flexible search queries find more listings
2. **Better Debugging**: Console logs show exactly what's happening
3. **User Feedback**: If search fails, user gets actionable guidance
4. **Reliable Fallback**: Demo listing always works as last resort
5. **Accumulating Candidates**: All strategies contribute to pool of candidates

## Testing

Try these queries to see the improvements:

1. **Narrow query**: "Find single-tenant NNN retail in Dallas, 4-6% cap"
   - Now tries 3 strategies instead of failing
   
2. **Broad query**: "Dallas commercial real estate"
   - Finds results faster with first strategy
   
3. **Direct URL**: `https://www.crexi.com/properties/2164390/texas-7-eleven`
   - Works as before (unchanged)

## Monitoring

Check the backend console logs to see:
- Which search strategies were triggered
- How many results each strategy returned
- Which URLs were attempted for extraction
- Whether fallback was used

Example log output:
```
[agent] Search strategy 1: Dallas retail (site:loopnet.com OR site:crexi.com) commercial real estate for sale
[agent] Strategy 1 returned 10 results
[agent] Strategy 1 detail URLs: 2
[agent] Search strategy 2: Dallas retail commercial property listing investment
[agent] Strategy 2 returned 8 results
[agent] Strategy 2 detail URLs: 3
[agent] Total candidates after all searches: 5
[agent] Attempting to extract from: https://www.crexi.com/...
[agent] Successfully extracted from: https://www.crexi.com/...
[agent] Final deals count: 1
```
