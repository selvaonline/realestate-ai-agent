# Watchlist Refresh Fix

## Issue
After adding a property to a newly created watchlist, the watchlist button (bookmark icon) required a page refresh to show the new watchlist in the notifications panel.

## Root Cause
The `WatchlistButtonComponent` only loaded watchlists once during initialization and wasn't notified when new watchlists were created in the main app component.

## Solution
Implemented event-based communication between components:

### Changes Made

#### 1. `app.ts` (Line 2965)
Added event dispatch after successful watchlist creation:
```typescript
// Notify watchlist button to refresh
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('watchlist-created', { detail: newWatchlist }));
```

#### 2. `watchlist-button.component.ts`
- Added `OnInit` and `OnDestroy` lifecycle hooks
- Added event listener to reload watchlists when notified:
```typescript
ngOnInit() {
  // Listen for watchlist creation events
  this.watchlistCreatedListener = (event: Event) => {
    console.log('[watchlist-button] Watchlist created, reloading...');
    this.loadWatchlists();
  };
  window.addEventListener('watchlist-created', this.watchlistCreatedListener);
}

ngOnDestroy() {
  if (this.watchlistCreatedListener) {
    window.removeEventListener('watchlist-created', this.watchlistCreatedListener);
  }
}
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   cd orchestrator && npm start
   ```

2. **Open the UI** at http://localhost:3001

3. **Test the fix:**
   - Search for properties (e.g., "warehouse in Dallas under $10M")
   - Click the bookmark icon on a property card
   - In the modal, click "Create New Watchlist"
   - Enter a name and save
   - **Expected:** The watchlist button badge should immediately update to show "1"
   - Click the watchlist button (bookmark in top-right)
   - **Expected:** Your new watchlist should appear without refreshing the page
   - Click the notification bell icon
   - **Expected:** The watchlist should be available for notifications

4. **Verify in console:**
   - Open browser DevTools console
   - Look for: `[watchlist-button] Watchlist created, reloading...`
   - Look for: `[watchlist-button] Loaded watchlists: 1`

## Result
✅ Watchlist button now automatically refreshes when new watchlists are created
✅ No page refresh required
✅ Notifications panel can immediately track alerts for new watchlists
✅ Proper cleanup of event listeners on component destruction

## Build Status
✅ Build successful (with minor bundle size warnings - non-critical)
